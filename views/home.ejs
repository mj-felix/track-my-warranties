            <p class="lead py-2">Have you ever looked for ages for that misplaced receipt for the expensive
                headphones
                which
                started malfunctioning just before the warranty due date?</p>
            <p class="lead py-2">Have you ever wished you didn’t throw away that receipt for the handbag for which
                the
                zipper
                has just broken down?</p>
            <p class="lead py-2">Have you ever tried to figure out from that faded receipt how many months of
                warranty
                you
                have left on that juicer you were supposed to use every day and now sits permanently in the cupboard?
            </p>
            <p class="h4 mb-3 py-2">There’s is a better way ... and it’s coming soon!</p>
